## 🐛 Critical Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Authentication Bypass
**Problem**: Test was loading without requiring login  
**Solution**: Implemented exact 360 feedback authentication workflow  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #2: Translation Key Errors
**Problem**: Raw translation keys showing instead of readable text  
**Solution**: Added couple-specific translation keys and updated UI logic  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #3: EmailJS Service ID Error
**Problem**: Hardcoded service ID didn't exist, causing email failures  
**Solution**: Switched to environment variables like working 360 feedback  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #4: TypeScript Interface Mismatch
**Problem**: Build failures due to dimensions object structure mismatch  
**Solution**: Updated dimensions to match TestResult interface expectations  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #5: JSX Syntax Errors
**Problem**: Adjacent JSX elements without wrapper causing build failures  
**Solution**: Proper JSX structure with parent wrappers  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

### Issue #6: Email Template Content and Duplicate Emails
**Problem**: Users receiving duplicate emails with wrong "360 Feedback" content instead of couple compatibility  
**Root Causes**: 
- Two emails sent during invitation (partner invite + incorrect owner notification)
- Both using 360 feedback template with hardcoded content
**Solutions**: 
- Removed duplicate owner notification during invitation phase
- Added couple-specific email parameters to override template content
- Implemented template fallback system for couple compatibility
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUE - August 23, 2025

### Issue #7: White Screen on Couple Compatibility Page
**Problem**: User reports "this link brings no contents but white background page"  
**URL**: https://korean-mbti-platform.netlify.app/en/tests/couple-compatibility/  
**Status**: 🔍 INVESTIGATING  

### Investigation Steps Taken:
1. **Build Check**: ✅ Build is successful, no TypeScript errors
2. **Test Definition Check**: ✅ Couple compatibility test is properly defined in test-definitions.ts  
3. **Code Review**: Multiple useEffect hooks with authentication logic could cause rendering issues
4. **Debug Logging**: Added detailed console logging to diagnose exact issue
   - Commit: `58de9d4` - Enhanced authentication and test loading debugging
   - Deployed: Waiting for live deployment to analyze console logs

### Potential Root Causes:
- **Authentication Loop**: Multiple useEffect hooks checking authentication could cause infinite redirects
- **Test Definition Loading Failure**: Test definition might not be loading properly
- **Client-Side Rendering Issue**: Page might be getting stuck in loading state
- **Route/Params Issue**: testId parameter might not be extracted correctly

### Next Steps:
1. Analyze console logs from deployed debug version
2. Identify exact failure point in component lifecycle  
3. Implement targeted fix based on findings
4. Remove debug logging after fix is confirmed
